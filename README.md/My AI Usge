# 🧠 My AI Usage

## AI Tools Used

I used the following AI tools during the development of this project:

* **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** – primary AI assistant used throughout backend development.

## How I Used AI

I used ChatGPT as a **development assistant**, not as a replacement for my own coding. Specifically:

* To **understand Spring Boot project structure** and best practices.
* To **design REST API endpoints** for authentication (register & login).
* To **generate initial boilerplate code** for:

  * Spring Security configuration
  * JWT authentication (JwtUtil, JwtFilter)
  * Controller and DTO classes
* To **debug errors** such as:

  * CORS issues between frontend and backend
  * `403 Forbidden` errors in Spring Security
  * Bean creation issues (AuthenticationManager, UserDetailsService)
* To **understand Git & GitHub workflows**, including:

  * Initializing a Git repository
  * Writing proper commit messages
  * Adding AI co-author information as required
* To get **step-by-step explanations** when errors were difficult to understand from logs alone.

All AI-generated code was **reviewed, modified, and integrated manually** by me to fit the project requirements.

## Difficulties Faced During Development

During backend development, I faced several challenges:

* Understanding **Spring Security configuration** and request authorization rules.
* Fixing repeated **403 Forbidden errors** caused by incorrect security filters.
* Correctly implementing **JWT token generation and validation**.
* Resolving **CORS issues** when connecting React frontend with Spring Boot backend.
* Managing **bean injection errors** such as missing `AuthenticationManager`.
* Learning **Git commands** and fixing mistakes while pushing the project to GitHub for the first time.

These difficulties helped me improve my debugging skills and deepen my understanding of backend security concepts.

## Reflection on AI Usage

Using AI significantly **improved my learning speed and confidence**.
Instead of copying code blindly, I used AI to:

* Understand *why* errors occurred
* Learn *how* different backend components interact
* Break complex problems into smaller, manageable steps

AI acted as a **mentor**, not a shortcut.
I believe this approach helped me grow as a developer while still maintaining ownership of my work.

## Current Project Status

* ✅ **Backend Completed**

  * User Registration
  * User Login
  * JWT Authentication
  * Spring Security Configuration
* 🚧 **Frontend & Dashboard**

  * Basic frontend setup started
  * Dashboard and full frontend integration are planned next

## Interview Readiness Note

I am prepared to **clearly explain**:

* Where AI helped me
* What problems I solved myself
* What changes I made to AI-generated code
* How I ensured correctness and security

I understand the importance of **responsible AI usage** and have followed the project’s AI co-authorship and documentation guidelines.
